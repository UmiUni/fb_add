Logical Plan

Open browser and ide / terminal side by side
 
Go to big boss Chaoran's friend page 

Start the program. It will first find all _add friend_ button. 
For each button it checks if the Name to the left of the button is Chinese, if yes it click the _add friend_ button.

@TODO

Go to Chaoran's friend home page and recurse on that friend's friend page.

Implementation 

Find _add friend_ button: implemented as find the squares with the special ratio. 

Check if Chinese:  implemented as using Google's OCR tool but not reliable plus requires browser resolution.
